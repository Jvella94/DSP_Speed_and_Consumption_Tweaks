# DSP Speed ans Consumption Tweaks

***** source https://github.com/hiul-dragonfel/DSP_Speed_and_Consumption_Tweaks *****

This mod is meant to be able to tweak the speed at whitch cargo drones, vessels and Icarus can travel.
It also adjusts the enregy consumption of each 3 entities.

Il made this mod to be able to make huge maps on Galactic scale 2 because the distances where too great and vessels where taking hours to travel subluminal and Icarus hadn't enought energy to travel interstelar.

Ofcourse compatible with GS2, I don't know if it is compatible with nebula
